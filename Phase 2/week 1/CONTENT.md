*`Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.`*

- *`Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers.`* 
- *`Cloud-based computing model.`*
- *`It eliminates (hides) infrastructure management tasks such as:`*

      server or cluster provisioning,
      
      operating system maintenance,
      
      capacity provisioning,
      
      downtime

- *Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed* <br>

`You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you!`
